To run:
 java Model
Syntax Pickiness:
 Close all parends. Always. Otherwise You will get an error.
 multiplication without the * is not supported unless you use parends. Ex: 5(cos(6)) will work. 5cos(6) will not.
    - also the variable button includes surrounding parrends so 5(x) works as expected.
    - uniary plus and minus will work.
Graph pickiness:
 The graph graphs using dots as to avoid any issues with asymptotes.
 The toggle lines button adds in connecting lines but does not support asymptotes.
Intersect Finder pickiness:
 intersection finder usage is as follows:
  1. add functions to the graph
  2. determine the left and right x bounds you want to search for the intersection in
  3. enter the syntax as follows firstFunctionIndex|secondFunctionIndex|leftXBound|rightXBound|
     so for the first and second functions from -1 to 1 you would enter 0|1|-1|1| then click the intersection button.
